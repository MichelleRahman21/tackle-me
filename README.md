# TACKLE ME !

## Project description

I want to design a full stack application where users can pick what they have in their closet, weather is a trend or not, should they add some new items or throw away some stuff they don't need anymore. People that need to organize their closets, people who know that it is time for a change but they don't have the time to categorize each item on their wardrobe. The idea comes after me thinking the other day that once I get into the job environment I need to change my wardrobe, and separate everything that I don't use anymore, there are some type of clothes that I might need in the future but I can't find a way to organize my wardrobe unless I track the things I have inside it!

## User story

### For authentication only:

As a user I want to be able to sign up.

As a user I want to be able to sign in if I already Sign up.

As a user I want to be able to change my password.

As a user I want to get messages for every other action I do in the application.


### For client interface only:

As a user I want to be able to get the list of items with their respective description.

As a user I don't want anybody to get access to my account unless they sign in with theirs.

As user I want to be able to create a new item.

As a user I want to be able to delete an item.

As a user I want to be able to update an item.

As a user I want to be able to view an item.


## How will my table look like

|---|---|---|---|---| ---|
|   |   |   |   |   |    |
|   |   |   |   |   |    |
|   |   |   |   |   |    |
